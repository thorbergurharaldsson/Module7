            <h2>What is a monorepo</h2>
            <p>
              A monorepo is a single repository containing multiple distinct
              projects, with well-defined relationships.

            <h2>What is a polyrepo</h2>
            <p>
              A polyrepo is the current standard way of developing applications:
              a repo for each team, application, or project.

            Monorepo: In the diagram we can see that everything in the
            repository is easily accessible throughout the codebase. everything
            uses the same version of each dependancy so you never have to worry
            about versioning. Polyrepo: In the diagram we can see that the code
            is split up into multiple repositories.

                If there is common code or a dependency that has to be used in
                different projects, we can easily share them between projects
                and work on them without having to worry about problems
                regarding versioning. For example with react components such as
                a button or a navigation bar that can be used in different
                projects.
              </li>
              <li>
                Monorepos can help simplify internal and third-party dependency
                management. Referenced dependencies all exist in the same code
                base, which helps address challenges like the diamond dependency
                problem and the concern of having multiple projects with
                multiple versions of the same dependency. I will talk more about
                the diamond dependancy problem in the next slide.
              </li>
              <li>
                Since the whole codebase is in one repository, all the code is
                accessible for all engineers in all teams. This can be a
                blessing and a curse, everyone can view and request changes to
                all code, but on the other hands there is no good way to manage
                view access to specific files and folders.
              </li>
              <li>
                The monorepo is a good way to get a new project up and running
                quickly since the dependancies and everything else is already in
                place.

          <h2>Large monorepos</h2>
          <p>
            Some companies host all their code in a single repository, shared
            among everyone. Monorepos can reach colossal sizes, for example:
          </p>

            <li class="fragment">
              <p>Googles monorepo <span class="fragment">86tb</span></p>
